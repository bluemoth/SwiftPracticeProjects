# SwiftPracticeProjects

This repository was created to track mini-projects that I completed (along with challenges) from HackingWithSwift. 

Purpose of each project was to create some small feature or program, and then customize it based on either a personal or supplied challenge. Doing this forces me to play with the code, insert my own changes, and see the result of the change.
